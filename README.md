# Conway's Game of Life

This is based on [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life), a cellular automaton that simulates evolution of life with four rules. In the game, at each step, a cell switches between "alive" and "dead" based on the status of its neighboring cells. 

Run the game using the following command:

`python gameoflife.py`

```
-x --xsize        number of rows
-y --ysize        number of columns
-i --input-path   file containing initial state
-o --output-path  path to output file
-n --generatons   number of generations
```
